Dart package to search and delete unused translations from `.arb` files, for all languages, all in one go.

> NOTE : This package has been developed keeping `flutter_localizations` package in mind, which uses `.arb` files for all translations.

## Usage

```sh
# Add translations_cleaner as a dev dependency
dart pub add --dev translations_cleaner

# Run the command to clean all the translations
flutter pub run translations_cleaner
```

## Why ðŸ¤”

Translations can be a very time taking process when the app starts to scale and there are a lot many translations.
Hence it is a good practice to clean the translations if it is not being used.
Checking for unused translations is tedious, hence this package.

## How ðŸ¤–

- `translations_cleaner` looks for all the `.arb` files located in the directory, and fetches all the translations, from all the languages.
- Then it looks for all the `.dart` files.
- All the translation terms are looked for in these dart files
- The translations not found in the dart files are removed from the corresponding `.arb` files, including any attributes as well

## Limitations ðŸ˜”

- This package currently works only for l10n achieved via `flutter_localizations`, which uses `.arb` files.
- There are other l10n packages which use `.json` and `.yaml` for saving translations. These are not supported currently
